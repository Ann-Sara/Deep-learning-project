This project uses text analysis and deep learning algorithms to analyse email content in order to  provide a new method for identifying phishing attempts.
The main objective is to increase email  security by integrating machine learning models into the analysis of Gmail messages via the Gmail  IMAP server.
It works by obtaining access to Gmail accounts via the Gmail IMAP server, extracting  email text, and analysing it using a multi-layered approach.
This project uses state-of-the-art deep  learning algorithms, specifically Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), to extract meaningful patterns and  features from the email content.
The model is trained on a dataset containing both legitimate and  phishing emails in order to find and generalize patterns suggestive of phishing attempts.
This makes  it possible for the system to differentiate, based on the intricacy of the language used in the email  body, between legitimate communications and possible phishing threats.
